                          J-pop

                J-pop (Japanese: ジェイポップ, jeipoppu; often 
                stylized in all caps; an abbreviated form of
                 "Japanese popular music"), natively also 
                 known simply as pops (ポップス, poppusu), is 
                 the name for a form of popular music that 
                 entered the musical mainstream of Japan in 
                 the 1990s. Modern J-pop has its roots in 
                 traditional music of Japan, and 
                 significantly in 1960s pop and rock music.
                  J-pop replaced kayōkyoku ("Lyric Singing 
                  Music", a term for Japanese popular music 
                  from the 1920s to the 1980s) in the 
                  Japanese music scene.[1]

                J-rock bands such as Happy End fused the
                 Beatles and Beach Boys-style rock with
                  Japanese music in the 1960s–1970s.[2]
                   J-country had popularity during the
                    international popularity of Westerns in 
                    the 1960s–1970s as well, and it still has 
                    appeal due to the work of musicians like 
                    Charlie Nagatani, Tomi Fujiyama, along 
                    with venues like Little Texas in 
                    Tokyo.[3][4] J-rap became mainstream with 
                    producer Nujabes and his work on Samurai 
                    Champloo,[5] Japanese pop culture is 
                    often seen with anime in hip hop.[6] 
                    Other trends in Japanese music include 
                    J-Euro in the early 1990s, namely Namie
                     Amuro,[7] as well, Latin music, CCM, and 
                     gospel music have scenes within 
                     J-pop.[8][9]

                    Sound source 
 
                The sound sample for Hatsune Miku (V2) was 
                provided by voice artist Sakie Fujita. This 
                choice was made after considering nearly five
                 hundred voice samples, as Fujita's voice was
                  "clear and lovely" (score 
                  かりやすくかわいらしかった) [8]. During the 
                  recording, Fujita recorded "cute idol 
                  vocals" for two days, three hours a day, 
                  with meaningless romanization (sound 
                  library recording sheet). [9] The demo 
                  music produced by the music source 
                  surprised Fujita Sakie and found it very 
                  lovely. [9] In fact, the sound output fro
                  m the source synthesis is not similar to 
                  the voice of Sakie Fujita himself. Although 
                  Fujita Sakie himself could still barely 
                  imitate it [10] (this later laid the 
                  "character" of Hatsune Miku's song, 
                  resulting in the Crypton team investing a 
                  lot of time and effort to adapt to the 
                  changes in the synthetic details of the new 
                  engine during the production of the new 
                  version of the Hatsune Miku sound library. 
                  Try to keep the original sound quality of 
                  the V2 sound library).

                    Creative upsurge 

            Hatsune Miku was immediately popular. A large
            number of fan illustrations about Hatsune 
            Miku appear on the pixiv website, and a 
            large number of dances, covers and other 
            works are posted on niconico Animation and 
            become topics, which in turn promotes the 
            sales of Hatsune Miku. By September 28, 
            2007, the number of submissions on niconico 
            Animation for Hatsune Miku had exceeded 
            2,000 [31], by mid-October 2007 it had 
            exceeded 5,000 [32], and by November 24,
            2007 it had exceeded 10,000. [33] In the 
            early days, many of the works used Hatsune 
            Miku's covers of well-known songs, but there
            were also many original songs, which 
            numbered over 1,000 by December 2007. [34]
            Three months after its release, some 25,000
            creators contributed to the work. [34] In 
            November 2007, VOCALOID's special fan-book 
            bazaar "THE VOC@LOiD M@STER" (ボーマス) was
            launched [35].

                    Cultural influence 

                At the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, which will
                 open on July 23, 2021, the Japanese 
                 synchronized swimming team will perform with 
                 the vocals of Hatsune Miku and Project 
                 SEKAI. At the closing ceremony of the Tokyo
                  2020 Paralympic Games on September 5, 2021,
                   a song co-composed by kz(livetune) 
                   featured Hatsune Miku in the background (
                   the vocal part is suspected to be entirely 
                   by Hatsune Miku). [57] 

 
                On August 25, 2021, the Japanese employment 
                information website Acaric announced Hatsune 
                Miku as its interim CRO (Chief Research 
                Officer). [58] 
                An online version of the school song 
                performed by Hatsune Miku was released on
                 February 23, 2008, and the song Sakura Rain 
                 became the graduation song of choice for 
                 many graduates. [39]
