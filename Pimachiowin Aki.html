                <p class="pim_p">Pimachiowin Aki ('The Land That Gives Life') is a landscape of rivers, lakes, wetlands, and boreal forest. It forms part of the ancestral home of the Anishinaabeg, an indigenous people living from fishing, hunting and gathering. The site encompasses the traditional lands of four Anishinaabeg communities (Bloodvein River, Little Grand Rapids, Pauingassi and Poplar River). It is an exceptional example of the cultural tradition of Ji-ganawendamang Gidakiiminaan ('keeping the land'), which consists of honouring the gifts of the Creator, respecting all forms of life, and maintaining harmonious relations with others. A complex network of livelihood sites, habitation sites, travel routes and ceremonial sites, often linked by waterways, provides testimony to this ancient and continuing tradition.</p>

                    Canada was once known for its thriving herds of woodland caribou. Today, the future is uncertain. Pimachiowin Aki is one of their few safe habitats left.
                </p>
                <p class="pim_p">
                    Pimachiowin Aki is a paradise for songbirds, shorebirds and waterfowl. Forest, wetlands and waterways offer birds critical breeding and nesting grounds, and rich sources of food on which to raise their young.
                </p>
                <p class="pim_p">
                    Pimachiowin Aki’s many shimmering lakes, rivers, streams and wetlands are teeming with fish, including lake sturgeon — the largest fish, reaching two and half metres long and weighing as much as 180 kilograms.

                <h1 class="pim_4c_title">Boreal Forest</h1>
                <p class="pim_p">
                    Pimachiowin Aki is part of the world’s boreal forest — a 1,000 km-thick belt of coniferous trees that wraps around the globe through North America, Asia, and Europe. The boreal forest stores more freshwater in wetlands and lakes and more carbon in trees, soil and peat than any other terrestrial ecosystem on earth.
                </p>
                <p class="pim_p">
                    Much of the world’s boreal forest has been cut down, cleared for industry or cities, and crossed by giant highways. But not here. For over 7,000 years, Anishinaabeg have kept the boreal shield landscape as it was gifted by the Creator — intact and not fragmented by human activity. This is an exceptional testament to the continuing Anishinaabe cultural tradition of Ji-ganawendamang Gidakiiminaan.

                <p class="pim_p">
                    Moose are hunted through most of the year, except mid-summer when the meat is less tasty. The shorter, cooler days of fall and the leafless fall forests provide ideal conditions to hunt moose as they concentrate along the rivers, lakes, and forest openings to mate.
                </p>
                <p class="pim_p">
                    Woodland caribou are not often encountered, but they are hunted, especially in the early spring when they can be found in small groups standing on the ice.
                </p>
                <p class="pim_p">
                    Waterfowl are a particularly important food source in the spring and fall, providing both meat and eggs. Once the ice has melted from the lakes and rivers, Anishinaabeg hunters in Pimachiowin Aki turn their attention to the well-known gathering sites where geese, ducks and gulls are nesting and migrating.

                    We are crossing land and water to inventory Pimachiowin Aki’s vast array of cultural sites, including petroforms, pictographs, Thunderbird nests, cabins, campsites, and ceremonial sites.
                </p>
                <p class="pim_p">
                    Some of our earliest research began with memory mapping. Anishinaabe Elders walked the land with us and showed us places and things that are only known because they have been passed down from generation to generation through oral stories. With Elders’ guidance, we created maps of cultural sites along travel routes on land and water. In some cases we returned with archaeologists and discovered ancient Indigenous artifacts, including pottery and art, dating back thousands of years.
