                Early video game music was the soundtrack that accompanied video games in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was usually composed of simple sounds generated by sound chips, such as programmable sound generators (PSG) or frequency modulation (FM) synthesis chips. These sounds were often called chiptunes, and they had a distinctive style and aesthetic. Some examples of early video game music are the opening theme of Gun Fight (1975) by Tomohiro Nishikado, the background music of Space Invaders (1978) by Taito, and the score of Pac-Man (1980) by Toshio Kai1.

                Early video game music had many limitations, such as the number of channels, the memory size, and the sound quality. The composers had to work with these constraints and find creative ways to make their music expressive and memorable. Some of the techniques they used were arpeggios, looping, modulation, and counterpoint. They also had to program every note and sound effect manually, using hexadecimal codes or assembly language.

                As technology continues to evolve, the video game industry has grown by leaps and bounds in the twenty-first century. While publishing a large number of classic games, their music is also widely known. At this time, Video game OST is no longer restricted by technology, and composers can display their talents more freely. Acoustic instruments began to appear, and pop and rock styles were well integrated into the music. Video game soundtracks get a new look.

Under the influence of her intuition, she set off in the direction of the lake; the ordinary magician Marisa Kirisame was watching the lake in the air, and suddenly found that the red mist blocked her sight. Thinking that monsters, like humans, cannot survive without water, Marisa resolutely set off in the direction of the lake as if looking for some valuable treasure.</p>

Because it was inconvenient to act alone, she invited Hakurei Reimu, a priestess from Hakurei Shrine, to set off to solve the mutation; The resident magician Alice Margotroyd saw that no one was going to solve the mutation, so she found the human Marisa Kirisame who also lived in the magic forest as a companion; the vampire Remilia Scarlet, entrusted the housework to Izayo Sakuya and set off on her own. But in the end, Sakuya followed Remilia and acted together; the master of Baigyokuro, Saigyouji Yuyuko, casually went out with the teacher Soul Yumeng. The four groups, consisting of one human and one demon, tour around Gensokyo in order to make the full moon appear again.</p>

                    The physicalization of video game music, which means that it can be heard not only in the game, but alsoonline music platforms and even CDs. Some famous video game music works such as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag and others are available on various music platforms.

                <li class="gameost_text_2010s">
                    The diversification of video game music, which means that it is no longer limited to traditional electrosynthesizers or symphonic music, but integrates various styles and elements, such as rock, jazz, ethnic, electronic and others. Some video game music works even created new styles, such as the retro-futurism in Fallout 4.

                    The internationalization of video game music, which means that it is no longer dominated by a few countries or regions’ composers, but emerged excellent composers from all over the world, such as China’s Wei Wei (The Legend of Sword and Fairy 6), Japan’s Nobuo Uematsu (Final Fantasy XV), France’s Olivier Deriviere (Detroit: Become Human) and others.
